In React, a fresh constructor is created, then all mixins are mixed in recursively,\n  // then the actual spec is mixed in last.\n  //\n  // With ES6 classes, the properties are already there, so smart-mixin mixes functions (a, b) -> b()a(), which is\n  // the opposite of how React does it. If we reverse this array, we basically do the whole logic in reverse,\n  // which makes the result the same. See the test for more.\n  // See also:\n  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n  }\n\n  return reactClass;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\n  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n  };\n\n  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n    return function(reactClass) {\n      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n    };\n  };\n\n  return reactMixin;\n})();\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/redux-devtools-log-monitor/~/react-json-tree/~/react-mixin/index.js\n ** module id = 547\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var objToStr = function(x){ return Object.prototype.toString.call(x); };\n\nvar thrower = function(error){\n    throw error;\n};\n\nvar mixins = module.exports = function makeMixinFunction(rules, _opts){\n    var opts = _opts || {};\n    if (!opts.unknownFunction) {\n        opts.unknownFunction = mixins.ONCE;\n    }\n\n    if (!opts.nonFunctionProperty) {\n        opts.nonFunctionProperty = function(left, right, key){\n            if (left !== undefined && right !== undefined) {\n                var getTypeName = function(obj){\n                    if (obj && obj.constructor && obj.constructor.name) {\n                        return obj.constructor.name;\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        return objToStr(obj).slice(8, -1);\n                    }\n                };\n                throw new TypeError('Cannot mixin key ' + key + ' because it is provided by multiple sources, '\n                        + 'and the types are ' + getTypeName(left) + ' and ' + getTypeName(right));\n            }\n            return left === undefined ?
