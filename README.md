# Sample Parking App

This was built on top of the React Redux starter kit; the app is a full frontend react app with no
REST/remote requirements. At this point no UI/use is made of the current reservations' inputs though
they are settable. 

The debug window has been left in place for observation of state changes; 
it can be edge-dragged right to get rid of it. 

To run locally you can use the dev server instructions at https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/tree/master/src.
